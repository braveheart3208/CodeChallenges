# Code Challenges - Android App Practices
This repository contains the Code Test called "Starships" which takes the requirements as below (Copy from Billy Hlaing Code Test).  

## Requirements
● Fetch a single page of data from the following API: https://swapi.dev/api/starships/
● Display the collection of starships. On this screen present 2+ properties for each
entry
● Allow the user to click on a starship to view more details about it.
● Users should be able to “favourite” starships from both screens. Don’t worry about
persistence across sessions (DB/SharedPrefs/etc); in-memory is fine. However
consider that the solution might be extended in the future to support this.
● A simple design based on Material Design (does not have to be strict)
● Use any third-party libraries to help with your implementation
● Concise, understandable code. Try not to over-engineer, however the solution should
be maintainable and production ready.
● Document any UX/UI/architecture/requirements assumptions
## Considerations
How does the user know which items have been favorited?
● What order is the data displayed in? Can the user switch between different sort
options?
● How does the user navigate back and forth between the list of starships and a
specific starship’s details?
● What happens if an API call fails?
## Library Used
● Google GSON
● ReactiveX
● Hawk
● Dagger Hilt
● Retrofit
